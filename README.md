## Language-Detect (not-not-language)
Positively defining meaningful language is 'hard'(impossible);
negatively defining not-language is not hard: most of the time.
1. Define not-language
2. count failures to remove all not-language words
3. count failures to remove all not-language sentences
4. count and return failures

It is possible much of the time to define
what is likely not a word,
and what is likely not a sentence,
with a set of simple steps and rules
that are based on empirical data and
that are not controvertial.

Using these rules and steps, is possible much of the time
to find effective word and sentence counts.
